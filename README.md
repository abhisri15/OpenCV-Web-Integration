# CV Web Application

Welcome to the CV Web Application! This web-based tool allows you to perform various image processing operations on your images using OpenCV.

## Features

- Convert an image to grayscale
- Apply a blur effect to an image
- Detect edges using the Canny edge detector
- Reset an image to its original state

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required for the CV Web Application:

1. OpenCV (provided via opencv.js)
2. Material Icons (provided via Google Fonts)
3. Roboto Font (provided via Google Fonts)

## How to Use
